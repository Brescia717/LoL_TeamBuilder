== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

ruby 2.0.0

rake db:setup

This app is still in development. The functionality of this is for a user
to be able to connect with other League of Legends players who are of similar
rank, times they are available, and find people to fill specific roles in order
to build a team in a more structured way than Riot's Team Builder.
